<h1>Introduction to Catalan as a Language</h1>
<p> Catalonia (Catalunya) is a autonomous county in the North East of Spain bordering Andorra and France. There are 4 main provinces where the capitals are, Barcelona, Girona, Lleida and Tarragona in order of size. Barcelona is the Capital and also the Seventh most populous Urban area in the European Union. Barcelona and Catalonia were founded in the late 8th century by a Frankish Vassal, the Count of Barcelona who was given the land along the Pyranees and bordering modern day France as a defencsive barrier against the invading Muslims especially against the Umayyad campaigns along the Ebro. The main language is Catalan but Spain is also spoken as the majority of Catalans are brought up bilingual.
