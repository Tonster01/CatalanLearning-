<h1>Introduction to Catalan as a Language</h1>
<p> Catalonia (Catalunya) is an autonomous county in the North East of Spain bordering Andorra and France. There are 4 main provinces where the capitals are, Barcelona, Girona, Lleida and Tarragona in order of size. Barcelona is the Capital and also the Seventh most populous Urban area in the European Union. Barcelona and Catalonia were founded in the late 8th century by a Frankish Vassal, the Count of Barcelona who was given the land along the Pyrenees and bordering modern day France as a defensive barrier against the invading Muslims especially against the Umayyad campaigns along the Ebro. Under Francoist Spain, Catalunya became oppressed, Catalan language was banned and many during his period did not learn how to write Catalan due to this. The main language is Catalan, but Spanish is also spoken as the majority of Catalans are brought up bilingual.</p>
